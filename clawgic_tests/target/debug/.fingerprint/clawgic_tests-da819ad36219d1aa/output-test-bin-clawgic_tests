Examples:\n\n```\nstruct Something;\n\nimpl Something {} // ok!\n\n// or:\n\ntrait Foo {\n    type N;\n\n    fn bar(_: Self::N); // ok!\n}\n\n// or:\n\nfn foo<T>(x: T) {} // ok!\n```\n\nAnother case that causes this error is when a type is imported into a parent\nmodule. To fix this, you can follow the suggestion and use File directly or\n`use super::File;` which will import the types from the parent namespace. An\nexample that causes this error is below:\n\n```compile_fail,E0412\nuse std::fs::File;\n\nmod foo {\n    fn some_function(f: File) {}\n}\n```\n\n```\nuse std::fs::File;\n\nmod foo {\n    // either\n    use super::File;\n    // or\n    // use std::fs::File;\n    fn foo(f: File) {}\n}\n# fn main() {} // don't insert it for us; that'll break imports\n```\n"},"level":"error","spans":[{"file_name":"/home/noel/.rustup/toolchains/stable-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/lib/rustlib/src/rust/library/core/src/iter/traits/iterator.rs","byte_start":1514,"byte_end":1532,"line_start":40,"line_end":40,"column_start":1,"column_end":19,"is_primary":false,"text":[{"text":"pub trait Iterator {","highlight_start":1,"highlight_end":19}],"label":"similarly named trait `Iterator` defined here","suggested_replacement":null,"suggestion_applicability":null,"expansion":null},{"file_name":"src/node_tests.rs","byte_start":1230,"byte_end":1238,"line_start":32,"line_end":32,"column_start":33,"column_end":41,"is_primary":true,"text":[{"text":"    fn operator_nodes(operator: Operator, ex1: bool, ex2: bool, ex3: bool, ex4: bool){","highlight_start":33,"highlight_end":41}],"label":null,"suggested_replacement":null,"suggestion_applicability":null,"expansion":null}],"children":[{"message":"a trait with a similar name exists","code":null,"level":"help","spans":[{"file_name":"src/node_tests.rs","byte_start":1230,"byte_end":1238,"line_start":32,"line_end":32,"column_start":33,"column_end":41,"is_primary":true,"text":[{"text":"    fn operator_nodes(operator: Operator, ex1: bool, ex2: bool, ex3: bool, ex4: bool){","highlight_start":33,"highlight_end":41}],"label":null,"suggested_replacement":"Iterator","suggestion_applicability":"MaybeIncorrect","expansion":null}],"children":[],"rendered":null},{"message":"consider importing this enum","code":null,"level":"help","spans":[{"file_name":"src/node_tests.rs","byte_start":27,"byte_end":27,"line_start":3,"line_end":3,"column_start":5,"column_end":5,"is_primary":true,"text":[{"text":"    use super::*;","highlight_start":5,"highlight_end":5}],"label":null,"suggested_replacement":"use clawgic::expression_tree::node::operator::Operator;\n","suggestion_applicability":"MaybeIncorrect","expansion":null}],"children":[],"rendered":null}],"rendered":"\u001b[1m\u001b[91merror[E0412]\u001b[0m\u001b[1m: cannot find type `Operator` in this scope\u001b[0m\n  \u001b[1m\u001b[94m--> \u001b[0msrc/node_tests.rs:32:33\n   \u001b[1m\u001b[94m|\u001b[0m\n\u001b[1m\u001b[94m32\u001b[0m \u001b[1m\u001b[94m|\u001b[0m     fn operator_nodes(operator: Operator, ex1: bool, ex2: bool, ex3: bool, ex4: bool){\n   \u001b[1m\u001b[94m|\u001b[0m                                 \u001b[1m\u001b[91m^^^^^^^^\u001b[0m\n   \u001b[1m\u001b[94m|\u001b[0m\n  \u001b[1m\u001b[94m::: \u001b[0m/home/noel/.rustup/toolchains/stable-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/lib/rustlib/src/rust/library/core/src/iter/traits/iterator.rs:40:1\n   \u001b[1m\u001b[94m|\u001b[0m\n\u001b[1m\u001b[94m40\u001b[0m \u001b[1m\u001b[94m|\u001b[0m pub trait Iterator {\n   \u001b[1m\u001b[94m|\u001b[0m \u001b[1m\u001b[94m------------------\u001b[0m \u001b[1m\u001b[94msimilarly named trait `Iterator` defined here\u001b[0m\n   \u001b[1m\u001b[94m|\u001b[0m\n\u001b[1m\u001b[96mhelp\u001b[0m: a trait with a similar name exists\n   \u001b[1m\u001b[94m|\u001b[0m\n\u001b[1m\u001b[94m32\u001b[0m \u001b[91m- \u001b[0m    fn operator_nodes(operator: \u001b[91mOperator\u001b[0m, ex1: bool, ex2: bool, ex3: bool, ex4: bool){\n\u001b[1m\u001b[94m32\u001b[0m \u001b[92m+ \u001b[0m    fn operator_nodes(operator: \u001b[92mIterator\u001b[0m, ex1: bool, ex2: bool, ex3: bool, ex4: bool){\n   \u001b[1m\u001b[94m|\u001b[0m\n\u001b[1m\u001b[96mhelp\u001b[0m: consider importing this enum\n   \u001b[1m\u001b[94m|\u001b[0m\n \u001b[1m\u001b[94m3\u001b[0m \u001b[92m+ \u001b[0m    \u001b[92muse clawgic::expression_tree::node::operator::Operator;\u001b[0m\n   \u001b[1m\u001b[94m|\u001b[0m\n\n"}
