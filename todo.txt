current goals 0.7.1:
- ExpressionVariable. cloneable variable type. way to make one or multiple at a time.
- make OperatorNotation disallow dangerous notations
- short-circuit evaluation for expression trees
- Expression_tree::node();


later goals:
- add predicate logic
- upgrade documentation
    - add example code to all functions
    - add time and space complexities of all functions
- random expression generator
- .comm_eq() (tells whether two expressions are commutatively equivalent)
- mutable and immutable expression trees
    - rework all of the '_with' functions to use immutable trees to save on space.
- JIT compiler

- optimize
- OPTIMIZE
- OPTIMIZE!!!
