current goals 0.7.1:
X ExpressionVariable. cloneable variable type. way to make one or multiple at a time.
    X make ExpressionVars it's own type to handle indexing nicer
X make OperatorNotation disallow dangerous notations
X short-circuit evaluation for expression trees
X Expression_tree::node();
X prelude added.
- update README.md to include ExpressionVar/s and OperatorNotation restrictions


later goals:
- add predicate logic
- upgrade documentation
    - add example code to all functions
    - add time and space complexities of all functions
- random expression generator
- .comm_eq() (tells whether two expressions are commutatively equivalent)
- mutable and immutable expression trees
    - rework all of the '_with' functions to use immutable trees to save on space.
- JIT compiler

- optimize
- OPTIMIZE
- OPTIMIZE!!!
